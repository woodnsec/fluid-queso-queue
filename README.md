# Queso Queue Plus

A queue system for Mario Maker 2.




## How do I use this?

You need to have docker engine and docker-compose installed on the system for this to work.  

First, you must clone the project. Either download the source or run the following command:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/liquidnya/fluid-queso-queue.git
```


After that, copy (detailed below) and configure the `settings.json` file with your favorite text editor. 
```bash
cp settings.example.json settings.json

# now edit settings.json with your favorite text editor
```

Next, build and run the image (detached):

```bash
  docker compose up -d 
```

To close the queue press `CTRL + C` inside the terminal.
```bash
  docker compose stop 
```

The container will restart unless stopped, including through a reboot. The queue will be persisted on your local host in the data folder - `data/queue.json` & `data/customCodes.json`.

## What does the settings.json contain?

The settings.json file contains several options to make the bot as customizable as possible.

`username` is the username of your bot account or your account.

`password` is the oauth token of the bot, including the portion that says 'oauth'. This can be generated at https://twitchapps.com/tmi/.

`channel` is the channel that the bot will run in. This should be your Twitch account username, only containing underscores and lowercase alphanumeric characters.

`start_open` is the toggle for whether or not the queue will start open. The default value is `false`.

`enable_absolute_position` is the toggle for whether or not absolute position (offline position) is displayed along relative position (online position). The default value is `false`.

`custom_codes_enabled` is the toggle for whether or not custom codes are allowed to be added to the queue. When enabled, users are able to add an alias to the queue as opposed to the real ID. An example of this is `!add Kamek`. Before usage, the broadcaster must add custom codes to be used. This is detailed in the commands section.

`romhacks_enabled` is a toggle for whether or not romhacks are allowed to be added to the queue. When enabled, users may type `!add ROMhack` to add a ROMhack to the queue. This does not send the patch, but rather gives the user a convienent way to enter the queue without a real level code. It is required for `custom_codes_enabled` to be toggled on to use this feature, and the ROMhack code is added/removed automatically from the custom codes list depending on this toggle.

`max_size` is the maximum amount of levels allowed in the queue at once. The default value is `100`.

`level_timeout` is the amount of time in minutes a level can be played before the bot will inform you that time is up. The default value of `null` means that the timer is deactivated.

`level_selection` is an array that defines the order that levels will be selected in upon using `!level`. Once the order is completed, it will loop.
Possible values are: `"next"`, `"subnext"`, `"modnext"`, `"random"`, `"weightedrandom"`, `"weightednext"`, `"subrandom"`, `"modrandom"`, `"weightedsubrandom"`, and `"weightedsubnext"`

`message_cooldown` is the amount of time in seconds that a user must wait before !list will display the levels in the queue after a previous use. 

`dataIdCourseThreshold` is the highest allowed data ID for course IDs. This is used to stop levels that do not exist from entering the queue, however it is very difficult to know and/or dynamically change this amount accordingly. As such, the default value is `null`, which ignores the restriction.

`dataIdMakerThreshold` is the highest allowed data ID for maker IDs. This is used to stop maker IDs that do not exist from entering the queue, however it is very difficult to know and/or dynamically change this amount accordingly. As such, the default value is `null`, which ignores the restriction.

`prettySaveFiles` if set to true the files in the `./data/` directory are going to be formatted with spaces and new lines. The default value is `false` to reduce file size.

`subscriberWeightMultiplier` is the number added as a wait time for subscribers. The default value is `1.0`. Setting this to `1.2` for example will give subscribers an advantage for weighted random, because they would get 6 minutes of wait time per 5 minutes of waiting. This can be set to anything greater than or equal to `1.0`.

`list` is the order of the `!list`/`!queue` command. The following values are possible:
- `"position"` - the list will be sorted by time added. (`!next`)
- `"weight"` - the list will be sorted by weighted chance (watch time, `!weightednext`).
- `"both"` - the list will be sent twice, once sorted by time added and once sorted by weighted chance (watch time).
- `"none"` - the `!list`/`!queue` commands will be disabled.
- `null` - the setting is automatically determined by what is configured in `level_selection`.

`position` is which position the `!position` command shows. The following values are possible:
- `"position"` - the position of `!next`.
- `"weight"` - the position of `!weightednext`.
- `"both"` - both the position of `!next` and `!weightednext`.
- `"none"` - the `!position` command will be disabled.
- `null` - the setting is automatically determined by what is configured in `level_selection`.

`showMakerCode` if set to true it will display `(maker code)` next to level codes in chat if the code is a maker code. The default value is `true`.

## What commands are there?

The following list contains all commands and aliases accessible by default to you while using the queue. All commands marked with an asterisk are only accessible to the channel owner.

It is important to note that all commands that draw a level (with exception to `!dismiss`) will first remove the currently selected level before drawing a new one.

`!open`* opens the queue and allows levels to be added.

`!close`* closes the queue and prevents levels from being added.

`!clear`* will remove all levels from the queue, including the current level.

`!add` adds a level or maker ID to the queue, provided a level code or maker ID follows the command.

`!remove`/`!leave` will remove a user's submitted level or maker ID from the queue. If used by the channel owner, a name can be specified to remove another user's level or maker ID.

`!replace`/`!change`/`!swap` will swap a user's level code for the one following the command. Queue position is preserved when this is used.

`!brb` will mark the user as offline. Their levels cannot be selected while in this state.

`!back` will mark the user as online. Their levels can be selected while in this state.

`!current` will show the currently selected level or maker ID as well as who submitted it.

`!order` will show the level selection order as defined in the settings.js file. It also shows what the next level selection will be.

`!list`/`!queue` will show an in-order list of levels in the queue. It will display the current level as well as the next 5 levels of those currently online. It will also display how many people in the queue are offline.

`!position` will output the user's position in the queue, provided they have one.

`!submitted`/`!entry`/`!mylevel`/`!mylvl` will output the user's submitted level code, provided they have submitted a level.

`!weightedchance`/`!odds`/`!chance`/`!chances` will output the user's chances of getting selected in weighted random.

`!level`* will select a level from the queue with respect to the order defined in the settings.js file.

`!next`* will select the next level from the queue.

`!random`* will select a random level from the queue.

`!weightedrandom`* will select a random level from the queue using the amount of time spent online and waiting in the queue as weight.

`!weightednext`* will select the level from the queue with the most amount of time spent online and waiting in the queue. If multiple users have the same maximum time spent then the level nearer to the top will be chosen.

`!subnext`* will select the next subscriber's level from the queue.

`!subrandom`* will select a random subscriber's level from the queue.

`!weightedsubrandom`* will select a random level from the subscribers using the amount of time spent online and waiting in the queue as weight.

`!weightedsubnext`* will select the level from the queue with the most amount of time spent online and waiting in the queue and being subscribed. If multiple users have the same maximum time spent then the level nearer to the top will be chosen.

`!modnext`* will select the next moderator's level from the queue.

`!modrandom`* will select a random moderator's level from the queue.

`!dismiss`/`!skip`/`!complete`* will remove the current level from the queue without drawing a new one.

`!select`* will select a specific user's level, provided it is defined after the command.

`!punt`* will move the currently selected level to the back of the queue.

`!customcodes` will display all of the custom codes that are set, provided the feature is enabled. If this is used by the broadcaster, it can also be used to add and remove custom codes. The appropriate syntax for this is `!customcode {add/remove/load} {customCode} {ID}` where `add`/`remove`/`load` is the desired operation, customCode is the custom code that the user would like to type (example being `!add Kamek`), and ID being the ID that the custom code is an alias of. If a code is being removed, the ID is not required. Please note that while adding or removing the custom codes from the *queue* are not case sensitive, they are case sensitive with this command.
`!customcode load` will reload the custom codes from the `./customCodes.json` file, so you can manually edit that file and then reload the codes without having to restart the queue.

`!persistence` * will give control over how and if the queue data is loaded/saved:
  - `!persistence save` will manually save the queue state (current level, queue, wait time) to `./data/queue.json`.
  - `!persistence on` will set the queue to automatically save its state whenever changes occur. (this is the default behaviour)
  - `!persistence off` will deactivate any changes to be saved.
  - `!persistence load` will manually load the queue state (current level, queue, wait time) from `./data/queue.json`. Please use this with caution since reloading the state can result in lost data and it is recommended to:
    - use `!persistence off` to prevent the queue from overriding changes you are going to make
    - make changes to `./data/queue.json`
    - use `!persistence load` to load these changes
    - use `!persistence on` to reactivate automatic saves



### Aliases
The following list of commands are available to manage aliases:

`!aliases` will display the available aliases management commands and the available commands you can put aliases for.
- `!addalias command alias` adds the alias `alias` for command `command`
- `!enablecmd command` enables the command `command`
- `!disablecmd command` disables the command `command` entirely.
- `!resetcmd command` resets the command `command` to default values.

The aliases are saved in a file in `./settings/aliases.json`. Please use this with caution. It might render the bot inoperable.



## Will you add [insert feature here]?

Possibly! If you have an idea for a change to the queue, feel free to post it to the issues board at https://github.com/ToransuShoujo/quesoqueue_plus/issues and we can look into getting it made.
